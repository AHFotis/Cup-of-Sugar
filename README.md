## Description 

Cup of Sugar is simply a platform for good neighbors to be good neighbors. Cup of Sugar users can easily find local and national resources, browse posts about what resources or services are available or needed in their community, and connect with one another to help fulfill those needs. Users can create posts of their own as well where they can offer up free food or clothing, or to ask for help with something in their home.

To achieve this functionality, Cup of Sugar utelizes Express, MySQL, Sequelize, Session-Sequelize, Handlebars, jQuery, javaScript, and CSS to allow logged in users to access existing posts, create, update, or delete their own posts. They also have the ability to connect with one another by commenting on posts. This application also features a customized user experience by dynamically rendering data specific to who they are and what they are looking for during their time on Cup of Sugar.
